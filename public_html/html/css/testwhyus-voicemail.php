	<h1 class="fancy">5 reasons why voicemail is 
	<br>killing your business</h1>
	<br>
	<h3 class="fancy">Whether you work for yourself or with a big team of people, see for yourself 
	<br>why letting calls go to voicemail during the day can kill your business</h3>
	<br>
	<div id="BlueBubble">
		<div id="BlueBubbleTextOneLarge">
		Killer One - The Hang Up… 
		</div>
		<div id="BlueBubbleTextOne">
		Did you know 70% of callers will hang up rather than leave a message on your answerphone?
		<br>
		<br>
		What if every caller who hung up on you was a potential client. How much revenue has your voicemail just lost you?
		</div>
	</div>
	<div id="BlueBubbleLarge">
		<div id="BlueBubbleTextOneLarge">
		Killer Two – Anonymous Callers…
		</div>
		<div id="BlueBubbleTextOne">
		How many times have you listened to a message and gotten excited about how keen the caller is about using your product or service, only to find that they didn’t leave you their name or their phone number?
		<br>
		<br>
		Whether you are brave enough to try blagging a call without a name, or patient enough to try and track down the number (assuming of course it wasn’t withheld!) it makes the initial contact between you and the caller far more awkward than it could have been, making any sort of sale far less likely.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div id="BlueBubbleLarger">
		<div id="BlueBubbleTextOneLarge">
		Killer Three – First Impressions… 
		</div>
		<div id="BlueBubbleTextOne">
		Love it or hate it, the fact is that we are living more and more in a 24/7 age, most of us can just about cope with the fact that business hours in the UK are roughly 8.30 – 6pm and we can live with getting an answerphone knowing that we are calling outside of these hours.
		<br>
		<br>
		Callers will, however, judge you quite harshly if they reach an answerphone in the middle of the day. Now it may be that you were all on the phone but the impression that is left with a potential customer is that you are either too busy to answer the phone and therefore too busy to take on the extra business they have for you, or that you simply don’t care about your customers.
		<br>
		<br>
		Either way it will flag up concerns to your potential client who might choose to work with someone else instead, because letting your calls go to voicemail can seriously undermine your clients’ confidence in your business.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div id="BlueBubbleLarger">
		<div id="BlueBubbleTextOneLarge">
		Killer Four – The Waffler… 
		</div>
		<div id="BlueBubbleTextOne">
		In business time is money, and having to do every job twice is a quick way to kill your business. 
		<br>
		<br>
		When you get a voicemail from a waffler, you know it. They always seem to call you after hours and you know that you need to give yourself at least 5 minutes to listen to it.
		They have probably done one of two things; either they have left you enough information to fill your notebook or else they talk at the speed of light. If you are very unlucky they do both!
		<br>
		<br>
		And regardless of which they do, you know that when you call them back they will repeat all of that information before the conversation gets started.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div id="BlueBubbleLarge">
		<div id="BlueBubbleTextOneLarge">
		Killer Five – I didn’t know you’d called… 
		</div>
		<div id="BlueBubbleTextOne">
		We’ve all done it, I momentary lapse in concentration, a voicemail you just starter listening too before getting distracted and even the odd accidental delete.
		<br>
		<br>
		Whatever the reason, there are occasions when you will overlook or erase a callers voicemail with absolutely no way of retrieving their details… at best just making you look bad and at worse losing you business. 
		</div>

		Summary…
